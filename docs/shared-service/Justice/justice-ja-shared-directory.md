## Background
{: mb-3}
Currently, meta data and contact information for Judges, Justices, Judicial assistants, and Masters are collected and updated in a number of different places. Services need to pull this data together to use within their service. The Justice/JA shared service aims to be the source of truth for this information, where Justices and Judicial assistants can come to update information and for all other services and systems to pull from.
