## Design system

The GOA design system is supported by the design system team. For help, questions, or feedback, contact the [design system team](#).
<br>

The design system team uses slack to communicate with the DIO service teams. You can find the different channels and their uses below:
<br>

| Channel name        | Description         |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [#design-system-releases-](https://goa-dio.slack.com/archives/C02P8S4T2AZ) | This channel receives automated messages from GitHub for releases only. Subscribe to this channel to get notified about ui-component releases. Releases may include new components, updates or fixes. |
| [#design-system-notifications-](https://goa-dio.slack.com/archives/C02PBQ8AJM8) | This is our “chatty” design system channel. Only subscribe to this one if you want to see updates for all of the following: issues - Opened or closed issues, pulls - New or merged pull requests (as well as draft pull requests marked "Ready for Review"), commits - New commits on the default branch (usually master), releases - Published releases, deployments - Deployment review notifications and Deployment status updates.   |
| [#design-system-support](https://goa-dio.slack.com/archives/C02PLLT9HQ9) | This channel is a place for you to reach out to the design system directly to ask a question. Have a question about a style, component, pattern, or some code. Our design system team will be monitoring the channel during office hours and will do our best to find an answer for you.      |
