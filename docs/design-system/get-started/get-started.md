# Get started

## Using guidelines, components, patterns, and shared services <a href="using-styles-components-and-patterns" id="using-styles-components-and-patterns"></a>

## Usage

When something is published in the DIO Design System as a guideline, component, pattern, we include details of how you can use it within the context of your service. This should help you decide whether it’s something you can use or adapt for your service.

You can ask questions or share your research by joining the discussion on GitHub. There are links at the end of each guideline, component and pattern page - under the ‘Help improve this page’ heading.

## Github discussions about guidelines, components, patterns, and more

GitHub discussions are open to everyone. If you have a need within your service, post a discussion there to share it with the larger community.
