`civil-actions-api`

Each document or hearing has a unique identifier made up of 2-5 character code.

**Examples of unique identifiers:**
- AF = affidavit
- SCDEC = Statement of claim - declaration

### How it works

- Access is secured and audited.
- In the future this system will aggregate data from CASES, possibly QBSS and new systems such as Court Case Management and QB Filing into a backing Data Lake.
